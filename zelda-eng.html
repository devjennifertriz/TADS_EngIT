                    <h2> Zelda </h2>
                    <p> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a 1998 action-adventure game by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan and North America in November 1998. The player controls Link in the realm of Hyrule on a quest to stop the evil king Ganondorf by traveling through time and navigating dungeons and an overworld. The series is centered around Link, a young hero belonging to the Hylian race, known for their elf-like pointed ears. Link shares a close connection with Princess Zelda, the princess of Hyrule and the reincarnation of the goddess Hylia. Each game in the series presents a unique story and objective. However, the overarching theme often revolves around Link's role as the protector of the kingdom of Hyrule and the Triforce from the antagonist Ganon. The Triforce is a sacred relic left behind by the goddesses who created the kingdom — Din, Farore, and Nayru — representing the virtues of Courage, Wisdom, and Power, respectively. </p>
